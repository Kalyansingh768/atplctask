        <h1>Welcome to our Cricket Website</h1>

        <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which
            is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps.
            The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at one of the wickets with the bat and then running
            between the wickets, while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by preventing the ball from
            leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are "out"). Means
            of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the
            fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground, or hitting
            a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters have
            been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by
            a third umpire and match referee in international matches. They communicate with two off-field scorers who
            record the match's statistical information.</p>

        <p>Women's cricket, which is organised and played separately, has also achieved international standard. The most
            successful side playing international cricket is Australia, which has won seven One Day International
            trophies, including five World Cups, more than any other country and has been the top-rated Test side more
            than any other country..</p>
